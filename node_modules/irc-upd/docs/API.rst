This library provides IRC client functionality

Client
----------

.. js:function:: irc.Client(server, nick [, options])

    This object is the base of the library.
    It represents a single nick connected to a single IRC server.

    The first argument is the server address to connect to, and the second is the nickname to attempt to use.
    The third optional argument is an options object with default
    values::

        {
            userName: 'nodebot',
            realName: 'nodeJS IRC client',
            password: null,
            port: 6667,
            localAddress: null,
            debug: false,
            showErrors: false,
            channels: [],
            autoConnect: true,
            autoRejoin: false,
            autoRenick: false,
            renickCount: null,
            renickDelay: 60000,
            retryCount: null,
            retryDelay: 2000,
            secure: false,
            selfSigned: false,
            certExpired: false,
            floodProtection: false,
            floodProtectionDelay: 1000,
            sasl: false,
            webirc: {
              pass: '',
              ip: '',
              host: ''
            },
            stripColors: false,
            channelPrefixes: "&#",
            messageSplit: 512,
            encoding: null,
            millisecondsOfSilenceBeforePingSent: 15 * 1000,
            millisecondsBeforePingTimeout: 8 * 1000,
            enableStrictParse: false
        }


    ``localAddress`` is the address to bind to when connecting.

    ``debug`` will output timestamped messages to the console using ``util.log`` when certain events are fired. If this is true, it will override ``showErrors``.

    ``showErrors`` will output timestamped errors to the console using ``util.log``, such as when certain IRC responses are encountered or an attempt to find the message charset fails.
    If ``debug`` is true, it will override this.

    ``channels`` is an array of channels to join on connect.

    ``autoConnect`` has the client connect when instantiated.
    If disabled, you will need to call ``connect()`` on the client instance::

        var client = new irc.Client({ autoConnect: false, ... });
        client.connect();

    ``autoRejoin`` has the client rejoin channels after being kicked.

    ``autoRenick`` has the client attempt to renick to its configured nickname if it can't originally join with it (due to nickname clash).
    Only takes effect when the client receives a ``err_nicknameinuse`` message â€“ if disabled after this point, will not cancel the effect.
    See ``cancelAutoRenick`` to cancel a current renick attempt.
    See ``renickCount`` and ``renickDelay`` to configure.

    ``renickCount`` is the number of times the client will try to automatically renick (reset each time it connects).
    It defaults to ``null`` (meaning infinite retry).

    ``renickDelay`` is the number of milliseconds to wait before retrying to automatically renick.
    It defaults to 60,000ms (60 seconds).

    ``retryCount`` is the number of times the client will try to automatically reconnect when disconnected from the server.
    It defaults to ``null`` (meaning infinite retry).

    ``retryDelay`` is the number of milliseconds to wait before retrying to automatically reconnect when disconnected from the server.
    It defaults to 2000ms (2 seconds).

    ``secure`` (SSL connection) can be a true value or an object (the kind returned by ``crypto.createCredentials()``) specifying the certificate and other details for validation.
    If you set ``selfSigned`` to true, it will accept certificates from a non-trusted CA.
    If you set ``certExpired`` to true, the bot will accept expired certificates.

    ``floodProtection`` queues all your messages and slowly transmits them to prevent being kicked for flooding.
    Alternatively, use ``Client.activateFloodProtection()`` to activate flood protection after instantiating the client.

    ``floodProtectionDelay`` sets the amount of time that the client will wait between sending subsequent messages when ``floodProtection`` is enabled.

    ``sasl`` enables SASL support.
    You'll also want to set ``nick``, ``userName``, and ``password`` for authentication.

    ``webirc`` is an object that contains WEBIRC credentials (if applicable).

    ``stripColors`` removes mIRC colors (0x03 followed by one or two ASCII numbers for the foreground and background color), as well as ircII "effect" codes (``0x02`` bold, ``0x1f`` underline, ``0x16`` reverse, ``0x0f`` reset) from the message before parsing it.

    ``messageSplit`` will split up large messages sent with the ``say`` method into multiple messages of lengths shorter than ``messageSplit`` bytes, attempting to split at whitespace where possible.

    ``encoding`` specifies the encoding for the bot to convert messages to.
    To disable this, leave the value blank or false.
    Example values are ``UTF-8`` and ``ISO-8859-15``.

    ``millisecondsOfSilenceBeforePingSent`` controls the amount of time the ping timer will wait before sending a ping request.

    ``millisecondsBeforePingTimeout`` controls the amount of time the ping timer will wait after sending a ping request before the bot receives a ``pingTimeout`` event.

    ``enableStrictParse`` will make the client try to conform more strictly to `the RFC 2812 standard <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2812.txt>`_ for parsing nicknames, preventing eg CJK characters from appearing in them.

.. js:function:: Client.connect([retryCount [, callback]])

    Connects to the server.
    Used when ``autoConnect`` in the options is set to false, or after a disconnect.
    Outputs an error to console if there is already an active connection.
    If ``retryCount`` is a function, it will be treated as a ``callback`` (i.e. both arguments to this function are optional).

    :param integer retryCount: an optional number of times to attempt reconnection
    :param function callback: an optional callback to fire upon connection

.. js:function:: Client.disconnect([message [, callback]])

    Disconnects from the IRC server.
    If ``message`` is a function it will be treated as a ``callback`` (i.e. both arguments to this function are optional).
    Outputs an error to console if it is already disconnected or disconnecting.

    :param string message: an optional message to send when disconnecting
    :param function callback: an optional callback

.. js:function:: Client.send(command, arg1, arg2, ...)

    Sends a raw message to the server.
    Generally speaking, it's best to use other, more specific methods with priority, unless you know what you're doing.

.. js:function:: Client.join(channelList, [callback])

    Joins the specified channel.

    :param string channelList: the channel(s) to join
    :param function callback: an optional callback to automatically attach to ``join#channelname`` for each channel

    ``channelList`` supports multiple channels in a comma-separated string (`as in the IRC protocol <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812#page-16>`_).
    The callback is called for each channel, but does not include the ``channel`` parameter (see the ``join#channel`` event).

    To optionally send a list of keys (channel passwords) associated with each channel, add a space after the list of channels and append the list of channels.
    For example: ``#foo,&bar fubar,foobar`` will join the channel ``#foo`` with the key ``fubar`` and the channel ``&bar`` with the key ``foobar``.

    Passing ``'0'`` to the ``channelList`` parameter will send ``JOIN 0`` to the server.
    As in the IRC spec, this will cause the client to part from all current channels.
    In such a case, the callback will not be called; you should instead bind to the ``part`` event to keep track of the progress made.

.. js:function:: Client.part(channel, [message], [callback])

    Parts the specified channel.

    :param string channelList: the channel(s) to part
    :param string message: an optional message to send upon leaving the channel
    :param function callback: a optional callback to automatically attach to ``part#channelname`` for each channel

    As with ``Client.join``, the ``channelList`` parameter supports multiple channels in a comma-separated string, for each of which the callback will be called.

.. js:function:: Client.say(target, message)

    Sends a message to the specified target.

    :param string target: a nickname or a channel to send the message to
    :param string message: the message to send

.. js:function:: Client.action(target, message)

    Sends an action to the specified target.
    Often transmitted with ``/me`` in IRC clients.

    :param string target: a nickname or a channel to send the action message to
    :param string text: the text of the action to send

.. js:function:: Client.notice(target, message)

    Sends a notice to the specified target.

    :param string target: a nickname or a channel to send the notice to
    :param string message: the message to send to the target

.. js:function:: Client.whois(nick, callback)

    Request a whois for the specified ``nick``.

    :param string nick: a nickname to request a whois of
    :param function callback: a callback to fire when the server sends the response; is passed the same information as in the ``whois`` event above

.. js:function:: Client.ctcp(target, type, text)

    Sends a CTCP message to the specified target.

    :param string target: a nickname or a channel to send the CTCP message to
    :param string type: the type of the CTCP message; that is, "privmsg" for a ``PRIVMSG``, and anything else for a ``NOTICE``
    :param string text: the CTCP message to send

.. js:function:: Client.list([arg1, arg2, ...])

    Request a channel listing from the server.
    The arguments for this method are fairly server specific, so this method passes them through exactly as specified.

    Responses from the server are available through the ``channellist_start``, ``channellist_item``, and ``channellist`` events.

.. js:function:: Client.activateFloodProtection([interval])

    Activates flood protection manually after instantiation of the client.
    You can also use the ``floodProtection`` option while instantiating the client to enable flood protection then; see also ``floodProtectionDelay`` to set the message interval.

    This should only be called once per Client instance, not on every connection, and cannot currently be deactivated.

    :param integer interval: an optional configuration for amount of time to wait between messages, defaults to client configuration value

.. js:function:: Client.cancelAutoRenick()

    Cancels the current auto-renick event; see the ``autoRenick`` config option for more details.
    Returns the interval object, if it existed.

.. js:function:: Client.canConvertEncoding()

    Calls the exported function ``irc.canConvertEncoding()``.

    Emitted when the server starts a new channel listing.

.. js:data:: 'channellist_item'

    ``function (channel_info) {}``

    Emitted for each channel the server returns in a channel listing.
    The ``channel_info`` object contains keys 'name', 'users' (number of users in the channel), and 'topic'.

.. js:data:: 'channellist'

    ``function (channel_list) {}``

    Emitted when the server has finished returning a channel list.
    The ``channel_list`` array is simply a list of the objects that were returned in the intervening ``channellist_item`` events.

    This data is also available through the ``Client.channellist`` property after this event has fired.

.. js:data:: 'raw'

    ``function (message) { }``

    Emitted when the client receives a "message" from the server.
    A message is a single line of data from the server.
    The ``message`` parameter to the callback is the processed version of this message, and contains something of the form:

    .. code-block:: js

        message = {
            prefix: "user!~realname@example.host", // the prefix for the message (optional, user prefix here)
            prefix: "irc.example.com", // the prefix for the message (optional, server prefix here)
            nick: "user", // the nickname portion of the prefix (if the prefix is a user prefix)
            user: "~realname", // the username portion of the prefix (if the prefix is a user prefix)
            host: "example.host", // the hostname portion of the prefix (if the prefix is a user prefix)
            server: "irc.example.com", // the server address (if the prefix was a server prefix)
            rawCommand: "PRIVMSG", // the command exactly as sent from the server
            command: "PRIVMSG", // human-readable version of the command (if it was previously, say, numeric)
            commandType: "normal", // normal, error, or reply
            args: ['#test', 'test message'] // arguments to the command
        }

    You can read more about the IRC protocol in `RFC 1459
    <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1459.txt>`_ and `RFC 2812 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2812.txt>`_.

.. js:data:: 'error'

    ``function (message) { }``

    Emitted whenever the server responds with an error-type message.
    See the ``raw`` event for details on the ``message`` object.
    Unhandled messages, although they are shown as errors in the log, are not emitted using this event: see ``unhandled``.

.. js:data:: 'netError'

    ``function (exception) { }``

    Emitted when the socket connection to the server emits an error event.
    See `net.Socket's error event <https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_event_error_1>`_ for more information.

.. js:data:: 'unhandled'

    ``function (message) { }``

    Emitted whenever the server responds with a message the bot doesn't recognize and doesn't handle.
    See the ``raw`` event for details on the ``message`` object.

    This must not be relied on to emit particular event codes, as the codes the bot does and does not handle can change between minor versions.
    It should instead be used as a handler to do something when the bot does not recognize a message, such as warning a user.

Colors
------

.. js:function:: irc.colors.wrap(color, text [, reset_color])

    Takes a color by name, text, and optionally what color to return to after the text.

    :param string color: the name of the desired color, as a string
    :param string text: the text you want colorized
    :param string reset_color: the name of the color you want set after the text (defaults to 'reset')

.. js:data:: irc.colors.codes

    Lists the colors available and the relevant mIRC color codes.

    .. code-block:: js

        {
            white: '\u000300',
            black: '\u000301',
            dark_blue: '\u000302',
            dark_green: '\u000303',
            light_red: '\u000304',
            dark_red: '\u000305',
            magenta: '\u000306',
            orange: '\u000307',
            yellow: '\u000308',
            light_green: '\u000309',
            cyan: '\u000310',
            light_cyan: '\u000311',
            light_blue: '\u000312',
            light_magenta: '\u000313',
            gray: '\u000314',
            light_gray: '\u000315',
            reset: '\u000f',
        }

Encoding
------

.. js:function:: irc.canConvertEncoding()

    Tests if the library can convert messages with different encodings, using the ``chardet`` and ``iconv-lite`` libraries.
    Allows you to more easily (programmatically) detect if the ``encoding`` option will result in any effect, instead of setting it and otherwise resulting in errors.
    (See also ``Client.canConvertEncoding``, an alias for this function.)

Internal
------

.. js:data:: Client.conn

    Socket to the server.
    Rarely, if ever, needed; use ``Client.send`` instead.

.. js:data:: Client.chans

    The list of channels joined.
    Includes channel modes, user lists, and topic information.
    It is only updated *after* the server recognizes the join.

.. js:data:: Client.nick

    The current nick of the client.
    Updated if the nick changes (e.g. upon nick collision when connecting to a server).

.. js:data:: Client._whoisData

    A buffer of whois data, as whois responses are sent over multiple messages.

.. js:function:: Client._addWhoisData(nick, key, value, onlyIfExists)

    Adds the relevant whois data (key-value pair), for the specified nick, optionally only if the value exists (is truthy).

.. js:function:: Client._clearWhoisData(nick)

    Clears whois data for the specified nick.
